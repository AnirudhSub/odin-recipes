       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>The Cure for Boilsis a potion which cures boils. It is an elementary potion taught to first-year students at Hogwarts. Its recipe can be found in Magical Drafts and Potions.When brewing the potion, the cauldron must be taken off the fire before adding the porcupine quills, or the cauldron will melt and create a horrid odour, and if it spills will cause the skin to erupt in vicious boils.If the potion is made successfully, there will be pink smoke raising from the cauldron.</p>
